Fraction class in objective-c
=============================

Personal Project about Fraction Class to implementent operations on fractions.

You need GNUstep installed, and then you can compile with this command line:

gcc `gnustep-config --objc-flags` -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries FractionTest.m Fraction.m -o FractionTest -lgnustep-base -lobjc

For the moment is only implemented the 'add' operation, but is in the road the other basic operations: subtract, multiply, divide
